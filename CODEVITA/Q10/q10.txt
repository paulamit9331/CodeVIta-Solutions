Minimum Product Array
TCS codevita 2016 round 1:
The task is to find the minimum sum of Products of two arrays of the same size,
given that k modifications are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array
can either be increased or decreased by 2.Note- the product sum is Summation (A[i]*B[i]) for all i from 1 to n where
n is the size of both arrays.
Input Format:
First line of the input contains n and k delimited by white space Second line contains the Array
A (modifiable array) with its values delimited by spaces Third line contains the Array B (non-modifiable array) with
its values delimited by spaces.
Output Format:
Output the minimum sum of products of the two arrays.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^50 ≤ |A[i]|, |B[i]| ≤ 10^50 ≤ K ≤ 10^9

Explanation for sample 1:
Here total numbers are 3 and total modifications allowed are 5. So we modified A[2], which is -3 and
increased it by 10 (as 5 modifications are allowed). Now final sum will be (1 * -2) + (2 * 3) + (7 * -5) -2 + 6 - 35 -31
-31 is our final answer.
Explanation for sample 2:
Here total numbers are 5 and total modifications allowed are 3. So we modified A[1], which is 3 and
decreased it by 6 (as 3 modifications are allowed). Now final sum will be (2 * 3) + (-3 * 4) + (4 * 2) + (5 * 3) + (4 *
2) 6 - 12 + 8 + 15 + 8 25
25 is our final answer
