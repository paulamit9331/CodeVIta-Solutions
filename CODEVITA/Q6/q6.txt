Longest Progressive Sequence

Given a sequence, the objective is to find the longest progressive sequence arranged in ascending order.

Detailed descriptions are as:


Problem

A sequence is said to be progressive if it doesnâ€™t decrease at any point in time.
For example 1 1 2 2 is a progressive sequence but 1 2 1 is not a progressive sequence. Let S be the
sequence and be represented by L spaced integers Ki, now your task is to find out the first longest
progressive sequence present in the given sequence (S).


Input Format:

First line will contain T, the length of the sequence and next line will contain T spaced integers Ki (where
i = 0,1, ...,L).
Line 1 T,where T is the length of the sequence
Line 2 Ki,where Ki is integer in sequence separated by space

Constraints:

1<=T<=10^6(one million)
1<=Ki<=10^9(one billion)


Output Format:

Line 1 longest progressive sequence present in the given sequence


Input

1 1 2 1
5
1 2 1 2 2

Output
1 1 2
1 2 2
